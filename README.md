Steps of building a back-end database on Azure and parse values from an iOS device to Azure

1. Create an outlook account and sign up for free trial on Azure (if you are not a user yet);
Tips: sometimes, you might have to go throught the Microsoft Support. I got an error message after I put my credit card numbers for the free trial. 

2. Log in Portal Admin and create a SQL database and have an idea about the SQL interface on Azure.

3. Create a mobile service module on Azure.

4. Follow the directions given on under the iOS tab and create the services connection between your iOS and Azure
Tips: Notice, this is a direction connection between your device and Azure, which is not recommended. 
Tips: It is recommended to build an application server between your device and your server (google why?)
